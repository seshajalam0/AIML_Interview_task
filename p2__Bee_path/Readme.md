INTRODUCTION:

  The project focuses on simulating the movement of a bee in a three-dimensional (3D) space using a system of differential equations. In nature, the motion of bees is complex and dynamic, often exhibiting irregular or chaotic patterns. To model this behavior mathematically, we use a set of coupled nonlinear differential equations, similar to the Lorenz system, which is known for producing chaotic trajectories.
The equations define how the bee’s position in 3D space, represented by coordinates xxx, yyy, and zzz, changes over time:

  Here, a, b and c are system parameters that control the behavior of the trajectory, while (x0,y0,z0) represent the initial position of the bee.
The main purpose of this project is to:
  1.	Numerically solve the system of differential equations to track the bee’s position over time.
  2.	Visualize the resulting trajectory in 3D space.
  3.	Analyze the movement patterns to observe complex or chaotic behavior.

By simulating the bee’s motion, this project provides an interactive way to study dynamical systems, visualize trajectories in 3D, and understand how simple mathematical rules can produce complex natural patterns.

2. Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to:
  1.	Simulate the movement of a bee in a 3D space using differential equations.
  2.	Numerically integrate the system to get positions x(t),y(t),z(t) over time.
  3.	Visualize the path of the bee using a 3D plot.
This allows us to study complex motion patterns and observe how a system evolves over time.
